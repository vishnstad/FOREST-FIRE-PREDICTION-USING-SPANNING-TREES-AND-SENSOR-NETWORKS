# FOREST-FIRE-PREDICTION-USING-SPANNING-TREES-AND-SENSOR-NETWORKS
create a robust forest fire prediction and monitoring system using sensor networks represented as undirected graphs
The implementation of the forest fire prediction system using spanning trees
and sensor networks involves several key modules, each utilizing wellestablished algorithms for optimizing communication paths and ensuring
robustness in the network. Below is a detailed explanation of the core
components and algorithms used in this project:
3(a) Graph Representation
The first step in the implementation is the creation of a graph to represent the
forest as a network of sensors. The sensors in the forest are modeled as
vertices, and the communication links between them are represented as
edges. The graph is constructed using both adjacency list and adjacency
matrix representations:
• Adjacency List: An array where each element points to a linked list of
adjacent nodes.
• Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where each cell indicates the presence (or
absence) of a connection between two nodes.
These graph representations form the backbone of the system, enabling
efficient pathfinding and network optimization algorithms to be applied.
3(b) Shortest Path Algorithms
Several shortest path algorithms are implemented to find the optimal
communication path between the fire detection sensor (source node) and the
central server. These algorithms are chosen based on their efficiency and
applicability to the sensor network's structure and dynamic conditions.
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the source
node (fire sensor) and the server. It works efficiently for graphs with nonnegative edge weights, ensuring that the data transmission follows the
most cost-effective route, reducing energy consumption.
Implementation Steps:
o Initialize all nodes with an infinite distance, except for the source
node.
o Use a priority queue to iteratively select the node with the smallest
distance.

o Update the distance values for neighboring nodes and repeat until
the destination (server) is reached.
• Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
Unlike Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford is capable of handling graphs with
negative edge weights. This can be useful in cases where the
communication cost changes over time due to environmental factors or
network congestion.
Implementation Steps:
o Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite, except for the source
node.
o Relax all edges for a specified number of iterations (equal to the
number of vertices minus one).
o Check for negative-weight cycles in the graph.
• Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is applied to calculate the shortest paths
between all pairs of vertices in the graph. This is particularly useful when
the system needs to compute multiple paths simultaneously across the
sensor network.
Implementation Steps:
o Create a distance matrix where each element represents the shortest
known distance between two nodes.
o Iteratively update the matrix by checking if a shorter path exists
through an intermediate node.
o This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n³), making it suitable
for smaller graphs or dense networks.
• Johnson’s Algorithm:
Johnson's algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths between all
pairs of vertices in a sparse graph. It is more efficient than FloydWarshall for large and sparse networks because it applies re-weighting to
the graph before using Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest
paths.
Implementation Steps:
o Add a new vertex to the graph and connect it to all other vertices
with zero-weight edges.

o Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm from the new vertex to compute a
potential function for each vertex.
o Re-weight the original graph based on the computed potentials.
o Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm from each vertex to compute the
shortest paths.
3(c) Dynamic Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Prim’s Algorithm is used to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
of the graph, ensuring that all sensor nodes are connected with the least
possible total edge weight. The MST is important for ensuring efficient
communication, minimizing energy use, and maintaining network stability in
the event of network failures.
Implementation Steps:
• Start with an arbitrary node as the root of the tree.
• Use a priority queue to select the edge with the smallest weight
connecting a node in the tree to a node outside the tree.
• Add the selected edge and its corresponding vertex to the MST and repeat
until all nodes are connected.
3(d) Handling Network Failures and Robustness
One of the key challenges in sensor networks is the failure of nodes or
communication paths. This can occur due to environmental factors or
hardware malfunctions. To simulate and handle such failures, the following
features are implemented:
• Path Failure: A specific edge in the network may fail due to
environmental conditions like a forest fire or network congestion. When
this happens, the system recalculates the shortest paths using one of the
shortest path algorithms, ensuring the network remains operational even
under failure conditions.
• Node Failure: A sensor node may become inactive. The system identifies
the failed node and recalculates the network’s spanning tree or shortest
paths to ensure communication remains intact.
• Add Edge or Vertex: The system allows for the dynamic addition of
edges or vertices to the network, simulating the expansion of the sensor
network or the addition of new communication links.

Implementation Steps:
• For path or node failure, remove the corresponding edge or vertex from
the graph and re-run the appropriate algorithm to update the network's
paths or MST.
• For adding a new edge or vertex, modify the graph structure (adjacency
list or matrix) and update the network’s optimization algorithms
accordingly.
3(e) Visualization and User Interface
The entire system, including the graph creation, algorithm implementation,
and failure handling, is visualized using Matplotlib for graphical
representation. This allows users to visually track the shortest paths,
minimum spanning trees, and changes due to failures in the network.
Implementation Steps:
• Use Matplotlib to plot the graph, highlighting the nodes, edges, shortest
paths, and MST.
• Dynamically update the graph visualization when edges or nodes are
added, or when failures occur.
